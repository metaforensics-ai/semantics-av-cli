# **SEMANTICSAV PLATFORM END-USER LICENSE AGREEMENT (EULA)**

**Copyright © Meta Forensics Corp.**

**IMPORTANT - READ CAREFULLY:** This End-User License Agreement ("EULA") is a legal agreement between you (either an individual or entity) and Meta Forensics Corp. ("Company," "we," "us," or "our") governing your use of the SemanticsAV SDK and its integration within the SemanticsAV Platform.

By installing, copying, or otherwise using the SemanticsAV SDK, you agree to be bound by the terms of this EULA. If you do not agree to these terms, do not install, copy, or use the SDK.

---

## **1. DEFINITIONS**

**"SemanticsAV Platform"** or **"Platform"** means the integrated ecosystem comprising the SDK, the CLI, and optionally the Intelligence service, as defined below.

**"SemanticsAV SDK"** or **"SDK"** means the proprietary, closed-source binary analysis engine that provides on-device malware detection capabilities. The SDK is distributed as pre-compiled binary library files. Detection models are distributed separately and updated periodically. Both SDK binaries and detection models are subject to this EULA and represent the core technological innovation of the Platform.

**"SemanticsAV CLI"** or **"CLI"** means the official open-source (MIT-licensed) developer toolkit that serves as the primary user and programmatic interface to the SemanticsAV Platform. The CLI enables interaction with all Platform capabilities and is the sole component responsible for all network communications.

**"SemanticsAV Intelligence"** or **"Intelligence"** means the optional cloud service that provides deep contextual analysis and advanced threat intelligence. Intelligence is a separate service governed by its own Terms of Service.

**"Publicly Available Platform"** means the specific Linux and Unix-like operating system versions (including x86_64 and ARM64 architectures) of the SDK that Company makes available under this royalty-free EULA at its sole discretion.

**"Analysis Output"** means any data, information, results, reports, classifications, scores, metadata, verdicts, confidence ratings, or other analytical products generated by the SDK during its operation.

## **3. RESTRICTIONS: THE THREE LAWS OF IP PROTECTION**

While the Tier 1 freeware grant is intentionally permissive regarding usage, the following three restrictions are **absolute and non-negotiable** to protect the Platform's intellectual property:

### **3.1 The Law of Secrecy: No Reverse Engineering**

You may **not**, under any circumstances:
- Decompile, disassemble, or reverse engineer the SDK binaries
- Attempt to derive, reconstruct, or extract source code, algorithms, neural network architectures, or proprietary data formats
- Use automated tools, debugging techniques, or analysis methods to discover internal SDK implementation
- Circumvent, disable, or interfere with obfuscation, encryption, or protection mechanisms

This prohibition applies regardless of purpose—including academic research, security analysis, or interoperability—except to the extent expressly permitted by applicable mandatory law that cannot be waived by contract.

### **3.2 The Law of Non-Competition: No Competitive Development**

You may **not** use the SDK, its functionality, or its Analysis Output to:

- Develop, train, test, benchmark, or improve any product or service that performs competing functions, including but not limited to:
  - Malware detection or classification systems
  - File analysis or threat intelligence platforms
  - Binary analysis or security assessment tools
  - Machine learning models for threat detection
  - Signature generation or behavioral analysis engines

- Create derivative works that replicate or approximate the SDK's analytical capabilities
- Build products or services that substitute for or compete with the SDK or Intelligence service
- Extract training data from Analysis Output to develop competing AI/ML systems

**This prohibition is universal**: It applies to internal projects, proof-of-concept systems, research prototypes, academic studies, and commercial products alike.

### **3.3 The Law of Acknowledgment: Mandatory Attribution**

Any product, service, or distribution that incorporates or utilizes the Publicly Available Platform **must** provide **clear and conspicuous attribution** to Meta Forensics Corp. and the SemanticsAV Platform.

**Required Attribution:**
- Product documentation, legal notices, or "About" sections must include: *"Powered by SemanticsAV"* or *"Malware detection provided by SemanticsAV Platform"*
- Public-facing materials should acknowledge Platform use where reasonable
- Attribution must be visible to end users and may not be hidden in buried configuration files or source code comments

This ensures that as the Platform becomes foundational infrastructure, our contribution is appropriately recognized.

---

## **4. ADDITIONAL USE RESTRICTIONS**

### **4.1 No Circumvention of Technical Protections**

You may **not**:
- Bypass, disable, or interfere with license verification mechanisms, API rate limits, or access controls
- Modify wrapper code to circumvent usage restrictions or alter compliance mechanisms
- Use the Platform in violation of export control laws or for illegal purposes

### **4.2 Public Benchmarking Principles**

Company encourages transparent, objective public benchmarking to advance the cybersecurity field. Publishers of benchmark results comparing the Platform to other products agree to:

**a) Full Transparency**: Disclose complete methodology, configurations, datasets, sample selection criteria, and exact product versions to enable independent verification.

**b) Reproducibility**: Make datasets, configurations, and testing tools available publicly or upon reasonable request.

**c) Good Faith Comparison**: Use the latest generally available Platform version configured per official documentation. Intentional misconfiguration or selective presentation designed to produce misleading results is prohibited.

**d) Balanced Reporting**: Present results with appropriate context, limitations, and acknowledgment that performance varies across environments.

Company reserves the right to publicly respond to and identify methodological deficiencies in benchmarks violating these principles.

## **5. DATA PROCESSING AND PRIVACY**

### **5.1 SDK Architecture: Pure Offline Operation**

The SemanticsAV SDK is a pure computational engine with zero embedded network communication capabilities. The SDK contains no networking code, performs no data transmission, and has no ability to communicate with external servers. All file analysis performed by the SDK occurs entirely on-device with complete network isolation.

### **5.2 CLI Architecture: The Transparent Network Gateway**

The SemanticsAV CLI (open-source, MIT-licensed) is the sole and exclusive component responsible for all network communications within the Platform ecosystem. This architectural separation is your guarantee of transparency: You can audit the complete network behavior of the Platform by inspecting the open-source CLI code.

### **5.3 Privacy Policy Incorporation**

Comprehensive details on data collection, processing, retention, user rights, and protection practices when using the Platform (including the optional Intelligence service) are provided in our Privacy Policy, which is incorporated herein by reference and forms an integral part of this EULA.

By using the SDK, CLI, or Intelligence service, you agree to be bound by both this EULA and the Privacy Policy.

---

## **6. INTELLIGENCE SERVICE**

SemanticsAV Intelligence is an optional cloud service governed by separate Intelligence Terms of Service, which are incorporated herein by reference and form an integral part of this EULA when you access Intelligence.

Intelligence requires a valid API key obtained through the SemanticsAV Console and is subject to its own pricing, usage terms, and service level agreements. The SDK operates entirely offline during scanning and does not require Intelligence access for basic malware detection capabilities.

By accessing Intelligence, you agree to be bound by this EULA, the Intelligence Terms of Service, and the Privacy Policy.

---

## **7. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS**

The SDK and all intellectual property rights therein—including but not limited to copyrights, patents, trade secrets, trademarks, neural network architectures, training methodologies, and proprietary algorithms—are and shall remain the **exclusive property** of Meta Forensics Corp.
